# Naomi's Dotfiles

I will be documenting the only relevant bits of my dotfiles in the README.

# `.zshrc`

The scope of it was to be as close as possible to the `fish` shell experience.

My `.zshrc` does not depend on `oh-my-zsh` or anything like that. Keep this in mind if you want to use that.

A note: the prompt is different from the `fish` prompt. This is on purpose. I love my prompt when it is customized and minimal.
If you are looking for a copycat of `fish`'s prompt, you could always make it and export it to `PS1`.

# Use it and/or do whatever you want with it really

You got a handy dandy `install.sh` for that.
